1.1
Added dedicated "uninstall" button.
Moved buttons to a lower panel for better consistency.
Mod now fully installs even if nothing is checked.
Mod now installs as a single VPK archive rather than a set of loose folders and files.
	This makes it easier to distribute configurations and wipe over old installs.
The installer now saves your TF2 directory to the registry, and attempts to recall it upon future loads.
	The registry path is HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\CompVMInstaller\TF2Path
	
1.0
