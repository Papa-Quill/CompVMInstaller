1.3
Added a new About window.
Added a visual image guide.
Included the installation of a preloader during the compilation process.
	This adds preload_room.bsp to the Maps folder, and adds the following line to autoexec.cfg:
		map_background preload_room; wait 10; disconnect
Updated for the most recent viewmodel changes (as of 10/16/2016).

1.2
The install/uninstall progress dialog is now Always On Top.
Updated animation files to support the July 28, 2016 patch.

1.1
Added dedicated "uninstall" button.
Moved buttons to a lower panel for better consistency.
Mod now fully installs even if nothing is checked.
Mod now installs as a single VPK archive rather than a set of loose folders and files.
	This makes it easier to distribute configurations and wipe over old installs.
The installer now saves your TF2 directory to the registry, and attempts to recall it upon future loads.
	The registry path is HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\CompVMInstaller\TF2Path
	
1.0
